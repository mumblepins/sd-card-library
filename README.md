If you are building locally, place the files here:

```cpp
// put the entire 'libraries' folder and everything in it here

..\core-firmware\libraries 

// rename one of the example apps located at ..\libraries\sd\examples\
// to application.cpp and place it here

..\core-firmware\src\application.cpp
```
Thanks to [@choosatron](http://www.choosatron.com) for your work on this!
